We incorporated the Phaser.io framework, and it uses a combination <b>HTML5/CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and JSON</b> to achieve amazing results.\r\n\r\n<t>We have incorporated elements of agent-oriented and object-oriented programming. If desired, you can create your own levels and implement them using the Level0 superclass. New Enemies can be crafted. New PowerUps can be designed. All using already implemented code!\r\n\r\nLovingly made by Joel Hunsaker, Aaron Schraufnagel, and Kyle Sessions, with help from Marilyn Ferguson.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: All non-original content is property of its respective ownership.
