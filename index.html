<a id="green-one" class="anchor" href="#green-one" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Green One</h3>

<p>As of June 29, 2015, the game can be found <a href="http://students.washington.edu/joelhun/">here (currently hosted on Joel's now-defunct student website)</a></p>

<p><b> Challenge yourself to cross side-scroller worlds in order to save the galaxy!
 In <i>Green One<i>, you must utilize your Gravity Switch and Laser Cannon to make your way across dangerous planets.</i></i></b></p>

<p><i>Green One</i> was built as a team project by University of Washington students for Computational Worlds. We incorporated the Phaser.io framework, and it uses a combination <b>HTML5/CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and JSON</b> to achieve amazing results.</p>

<p>We have incorporated elements of agent-oriented and object-oriented programming. If desired, you can create your own levels and implement them using the Level0 superclass. New Enemies can be crafted. New PowerUps can be designed. All using already implemented code!</p>

<p>Lovingly made by Joel Hunsaker, Aaron Schraufnagel, and Kyle Sessions, with help from Marilyn Ferguson.</p>
